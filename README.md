This repository contains code for Photoluminescence, Optical Tweezer, Lock-In Hall, and Single Photon Interference.  
For the code, we have uploaded some data to the repository.

## Photoluminescence
Photoluminescence (abbreviated as PL) is light emission from any form of matter after the absorption of photons (electromagnetic radiation).  
The data consists of the following:
- **10K ~ 290K PL of low-pressure Ruby**
- **NOISEOF567AREA** : Noise with central wavelength(567nm) of Rodamine. Without Rodamine, with fluorescent lamp.
- **NOISEWITHHAND670AREA** : Noise with central wavelength(670nm) of Ruby. Without Ruby, with fluorescent lamp.
- **NOISEWITHOUTHAND** : Noise with central wavelength(670nm) of Ruby. 10K Ruby with some of fluorescent lamp.
- **NORUBYRODAMINE** : Noise without any sample(Ruby, Rodamine). Just with some of fluorescent lamp.
- **RODAMINE** : PL of room temperature rodamine.
